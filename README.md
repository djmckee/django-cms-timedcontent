# django-cms-timedcontent
A scheduled content plugin for Django CMS (originally intended for scheduled 'timed' offers to appear on a Django CMS site).

The template is deliberatly very simple and basic, and is designed really for customisation for your use case (unless you just want really simple scheduled content for your Django CMS project).


## To install
Checkout and copy the timedoffers folder to the directory containing your Django apps, then add 'timedoffers' to your INSTALLED_APPS in your Django project's settings.py file. Then you can drag the 'Timed Offers' plugin in to your Django CMS pages in the interactive editor, and add offers in the admin panel.

## Requirements
* [Django CMS v3](http://www.django-cms.org/en/)
* [Django 1.6](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/releases/1.6/) with [South](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/South)
* Python 2.7

## Status
[Basic](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/06/df/50/06df506cfd01c09b6b876f0ff00c4dbc.jpg), but ready for use and being currently used in the real world.
